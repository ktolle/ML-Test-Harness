# ML-Test-Harness
This Juptyer Notebook steps through several different classifiers for creating several machine learning models.

* Logistic Regression
* Linear Discrimnant Analysis
* k-nearest Neighbors
* CART
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machines

It's important to identify which algorithm is the best one for the problem you are trying to solve. This notebook helps us build a "test harness" to determining which has the best accuracy.
